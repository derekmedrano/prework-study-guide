# <prework-study-guide>

## Description

The prework-study-guide is a webpage intended for studying and preparing for coding bootcamp. I built the project to not only have the resource, but also to learn coding fundementals before class even starts. I now am fully prepared for class and have set up, downloaded, and/or installed all the necessary resources. I learned very basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
